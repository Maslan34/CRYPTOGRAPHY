To be or not to be, That is the question Despite the fact that Deep Ecologists and David Foreman advocates that humans have detrimental effects on ecology, Neo-Malthusians are even more blaming the society to destroy the nature on a hate basis. Even Deep Ecologists are holding the humans more responsible from the devastation nature and wild life, Neo-Malthusians press the burden to poor people, more likely. According to Neo-Malthusians, these uneducated and poor people are devastating the nature where elites and rich people are not responsible for. This essay will going to illuminate the point that, the two fractions are diverse from each other. At glance, even if David Foreman has been found guilty for some cases like THERMCON, later he admitted that incorporation of Marxists and Anarchists leaded the movement in a wrong direction. He just tried to protect the nature and wild life from the profit ambition of big companies and that doesn’t make him bad. ( Counterpunch, 2015) On the other hand, Deep Ecologists claims that the welfare and prosperous of human and nonhuman life cycle on world have worth in themselves and people have no claim to decrease this fruitfulness and variety with the exception of to please crucial people requirements. Despite the fact that Deep Ecologists are more hateful towards the effect of human life towards the nature and wild life, they hold responsible the whole people as a whole: poor and rich. Only thing we would connect Deep Ecologist and Neo Malthusians on the population control basis. Both parties claim that we need to control the population growth because, as the population flourishes more supplies will be needed however where the population grows exponentially, supplies are growing arithmetically as Thomas Robert Malthus suggested in his book Essay on the Principle of Population. (Malthus, 1798) Neo-Malthusians advanced the Malthusians’ ideas on two points: they stood on birth control approaches besides likewise recognized the working class with the glitch of overpopulation. The congested industrial favelas were recognized as places of moral deterioration. (Shah, 2013) The Neo-Malthusian position originate courtesy with the elite opinions on the subject of overpopulation. The elite, endangered by the rising quantities of masses, measured birth control as a significant ways of testing forthcoming struggle over their belongings. Thus, as far as we can observe, Neo-Malthusians were the backer of elites where David Foreman and Deep Ecologists are the protector of nature and wild life. Although all of them care for nature and birth control, they differentiate at certain points. Labelling the Deep Ecologist and David Foreman is a mean argument whether they did something wrong as in the case of THERMCON and Deep Ecologists hate for human as in the critics of Murray Bookchin. (Bookchin, 1987) Besides, as the Neo-Malthusians take poor into account for the bad effects on nature and wild life, others consider the whole human kind. Moreover, Neo-Malthusians just care the welfare of elites in the name of “ecology and wild life”. If we act in a responsible way, we can stop the devastation of nature and wild like. Overpopulation is not the problem, human behavior is.Both ideas defends the national sovereignty over the fiscal policies and states that it is impractical to regulate markets globally because of many reasons: nation to nation differences – demographic, fiscal, the way of living alters among the nations so it’s impractical to implement a global standards, nations do not want to give up their control over their markets – who will be the supreme force, labor standards bite the unification – child labor and such applications may not be appropriate for Western world, environmental/safety/health standards – if any country desires higher standards will trade rules prevent them?
